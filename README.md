# T-Shirt Search Program in Java

This Java project is a simple yet efficient standalone program designed to help users find their desired T-shirts. By reading T-shirt data from CSV files for popular brands like Nike, Puma, and Adidas, the program loads and displays matching products based on user preferences. Users can input search criteria such as color, size, or brand name, and the program will swiftly return a list of relevant T-shirts. The dynamic loading of data allows easy scalability to include more brands or T-shirt variations. With an intuitive command-line interface, this project offers an opportunity for contributions to enhance the search algorithm or add new features.
